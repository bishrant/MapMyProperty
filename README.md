# MapMyProperty
A revised version of map my property that integrates Draw My Ranch, Plan My Land Operation and the existing map my property into a single one.

Bootstrapped using Angular CLI 9x. Will use at least 9.0.0 angular version.
ESRI ArcGIS JS will be compiled using ArcGIS Webpack plugin https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin which uses Dojo Webpack Plugin underneath.

Use of esri-loader is discouraged for overall consistency and portability of the application.
