    content="The Plan My Land Operation application is a mechanism for the Texas A&M Forest Service to provide users with tools to locate and map their project area, identify sensitive areas including streams, wet areas, and steep slopes, buffer these special features, determine operational characteristics of mapped soil types such as rutting potential and erosion hazard, calculate the watershed area for a selected point, and determine the elevation profile of a linear feature, such as a road or trail. The application also allows users to save and print reports with operational considerations and Best Management Practice recommendations.">
