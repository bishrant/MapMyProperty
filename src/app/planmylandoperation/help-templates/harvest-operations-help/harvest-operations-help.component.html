<p>This toolbox displays selected harvest operations information from the NRCS SSURGO (for more information please refer to soils toolbox help).&nbsp;&nbsp;For these, a legend
    appears for the following soil characteristics, or attributes:</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Drainage Class</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural drainage condition of the soil refers to the frequency and duration of wet periods.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Suitability for Roads and Log Landings</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitability for using the natural surface of the soil for roads and as log landings in forested areas.  The ratings are based on slope, rock fragments on the surface, plasticity index, content of sand, the Unified classification of the soil, depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, and the hazard of soil slippage.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Construction Limitations for Haul Roads and Log Landings</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;For limitations affecting the construction of haul roads and log landings, the ratings are basedon slope, flooding, permafrost, plasticity index, the hazard of soil slippage, content of sand, the Unified classification of the soil, rock fragments on or belowthe surface, depth to a restrictive layer that is indurated, depth to a water table, and ponding.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Harvest Equipment Operability</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitability for use of forestland harvesting equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings are based on slope, rock fragments on the surface,plasticity index, content of sand, the Unified classification of the soil, depth to a water table, and ponding. Standard rubber-tire skidders and bulldozers areassumed to be used for ground-based harvesting and transport.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Erosion Hazard: Off-Road/Off-Trail</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazard of soil loss from off-road and off-trail areas after disturbance activities that expose the soil surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theratings are based on slope and soil erosion factor K. The soil loss is caused by sheet or rill erosion in off-road or off-trail areas where 50 to 75 percent ofthe surface has been exposed by logging, grazing, mining, or other kinds of disturbance.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Erosion Hazard - Road/Trail</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings in this interpretation indicate the hazard of soil loss from unsurfaced roads and trails.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings are based onsoil erosion factor K, slope, and content of rock fragments.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Soil Rutting Hazard</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazard of surface rut formation through the operation of forestland equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soil displacement and puddling (soil deformation and compaction) may occur simultaneously with rutting.</p>

<p class="mt-2">To make the layer transparent, you can move the slider handle to the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;This transparency slider is synchronized with the one in soils and regeneration operations so, the transparency will be applied to all these three toolboxes layers.</p>

<p class="mt=2">Since the information is coming from the same source as soils and regeneration operations, once one of the three gets processed, the other two get also processed.</p>

    map showing the distribution of the selected harvesting operation classification within the project area and area for each one of the
    values.&nbsp;&nbsp;Optionally, a <b>Report Title</b> can be added.</p>
