<p>The Plot Layout tool allows a user to create a map showing the layout of sample plots in a forest stand or management
    area based on several user-defined parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the tool produces coordinates for locating
    the plots while in the field. These coordinates can either be entered directly into a GPS unit or can be loaded to a
    GPS unit as a GPX file that is produced by the tool.</p>

<p class="mt-2">To use the tool, a single polygon will need to be available on the screen, whether drawn or loaded to
    the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a polygon is available, clicking on the Plot Layout toolbox will expand and expose
    the various parameters needed to produce sample plots.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Two main parameters are required <i>(although defaults are provided)</i>: Plot Spacing and Plot
    Direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plot Spacing</b> can be defined in units of either feet or chains <i>(1 chain = 66
    feet)</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both distance between plots within a row and distance between rows can be defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;By
    default, it is based on using 20<sup>th</sup>-acre plots and the stand size.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Once plot spacing has been specified, <b>Plot Direction</b> can be defined anywhere from 0 to 360
    degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plots are numbered moving in one direction <i>(not back and forth, or
        zig-zag)</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plot orientation based on cardinal directions <i>(North, South, East, West)</i> will be
    numbered in a logical manner, whereas, in some cases when other angles are used, plot numbering may appear less than
    ideal.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be kept in mind when defining an angle.</p>

<p class="mt-2">After all parameters have been set, the <b>Run</b> button is clicked to perform the calculations and
    produce the plots.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the plots and their respective plot number labels will
    appear.</p>

<p class="mt-2">To change the layout, click <b>Clear</b> and re-define the parameters and run
    again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an acceptable layout is produced, enter a <b>Report Title</b> and <b>GPX point prefix</b> 
    <i>(if needed when more than one GPX file will loaded on a GPS unit)</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click <b>Report/GPX</b> to
    download two files: (1) a PDF map that also contains a table of plot coordinates, and (2) a GPX file that can be
    loaded onto a GPS unit <i>(ensure browser popups are allowed)</i>.</p>
