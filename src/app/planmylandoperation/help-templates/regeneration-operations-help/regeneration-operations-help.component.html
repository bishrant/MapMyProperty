<p>This toolbox displays selected regeneration operations information from the NRCS SSURGO (for more information please refer to soils toolbox help).&nbsp;&nbsp;For these, a legend
    appears for the following soil characteristics, or attributes:</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Potential for Seedling Mortality</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings in this interpretation indicate the likelihood of death of naturally or artificially propagated tree seedlings, as influenced by soil characteristics, physiographic features, and climatic conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Considered in the ratings are flooding, ponding, depth to a water table, content of lime, reaction, available water capacity, soil moisture regime, soil temperature regime, aspect, and slope.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Mechanical Site Preparation (Surface)</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitability for use of surface-altering soil tillage equipment during site preparation in forested areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings are based on slope, depth to a restrictive layer, plasticity index, rock fragments on or below the surface, depth to a water table, and ponding.&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the soil from the surface to a depth of about 1 foot is considered in the ratings.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Mechanical Site Preparation (Deep)</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitability for the use of deep soil tillage equipment during site preparation in forested areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings are based on slope, depth to a restrictive layer, rock fragments on or below the surface, depth to a water table, and ponding.&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the soil from the surface to a depth of about 3 feet is considered in the ratings.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Suitability for Machine Planting</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected difficulty of planting trees or shrubs using a mechanical planter.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings are based on slope, depth to a restrictive layer, content of sand, plasticity index, rock fragments on or below the surface, depth to a water table, and ponding&nbsp;&nbsp;It is assumed that necessary site preparation is completed before seedlings are planted.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Suitability for Hand Planting</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected difficulty of hand planting of forestland plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings are based on slope, depth to a restrictive layer, content of sand, plasticity index, rock fragments on or below the surface, depth to a water table, and ponding.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is assumed that necessary site preparation is completed before seedlings are planted.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Potential for Damage by Fire</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential for damage to nutrient, physical, and biotic soil characteristics by fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratings involve an evaluation of the potential impact of prescribed fires or wildfires that are intense enough to remove the duff layer and consume organic matter in the surface layer.</p>
    
<p class="mt-2">To make the layer transparent, you can move the slider handle to the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;This transparency slider is synchronized with the one in soils and harvesting operations so, the transparency will be applied to all layers in the three toolboxes.</p>

<p class="mt=2">Since the information is coming from the same source as soils and harvesting operations, once one of the three gets processed, the other two get also processed.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Click <b>Create a Report</b> to produce a one-page PDF report that summarizes project area including a
    map showing the distribution of the selected regeneration operation classification within the project area and area for each one of the
    attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Optionally, a <b>Report Title</b> can be added.</p>
