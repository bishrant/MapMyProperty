<p>This toolbox allows for display of various sensitive areas within a project area from a context of Best Management
    Practices (BMPs) for the protection of soil and water quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitive areas include stream buffers, also called
    streamside management zone (SMZs), severe slopes and wet areas.</p>

<p class="mt-2">To display sensitive areas, click on any of the checkboxes provided for the various types of sensitive
    areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that you will first need to have defined a boundary for a project area.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first
    time this toolbox is opened, all the processing to produce sensitive areas is conducted for the project area and
    turned on.</p>

<p class="mt-2">By default, the SMZs are produced using a 50-ft buffer and wet areas have no buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;For both
    SMZs and wet areas, you can define the buffer width to use by entering the value in feet and clicking the
    <b>Buffer</b> button.&nbsp;&nbsp;To define a buffer width, click on the plus <b>(+)</b> sign to the left of either
    SMZ or wet areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;For SMZs, an additional 5 feet is added to the buffer width to account for the stream
    width.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Severe slopes are considered over 8% by default.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can define the minimum percent value of
    slope that you consider severe by clicking on the plus <b>(+)</b> sign to the left of the severe slopes, entering
    the value in percentage and clicking the <b>Set</b> button.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Click <b>Create a Report</b> to produce a one-page PDF report that summarizes project area including a
    map showing the sensitive areas within the project area and area/distance for each one of the
    parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Optionally, a <b>Report Title</b> can be added.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Streams were produced from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).</p>

<p class="mt-2">Wet areas was produced from geospatial data provided by the National Wetlands Inventory, a program
    established by U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service; however, they are not necessarily jurisdictional wetlands as defined by
    EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Severe slopes was produced from a 10-meter Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</p>
