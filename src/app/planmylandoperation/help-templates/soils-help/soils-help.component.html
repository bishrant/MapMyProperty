<p>This toolbox contains several tools for displaying soils and their attributes either across the entire map or just
    within the project area boundary.</p>

<p class="mt-2">To display the soils across the whole map, check the <b>Visible</b> checkbox; however, they only display at a high zoom level.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To investigate various attributes associated with an individual
    soil, check the <b>Identify</b> checkbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Identify checkbox checked, click on an individual soil on the map to
    display a window listing a set of selected attributes for that soil.</p>

<p class="mt-2">You can clip the soils to the boundary of your project area by clicking on the <b>Clip</b> button.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
    using this tool, ensure a single project area boundary is displayed on the map and that this area is less than 100,000
    acres.&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the clipped soils layer transparent, you can move the
    <b>Layer Transparency</b> slider handle to the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;A transparency value of 75 and greater will cause the active layer
    to display with no fill and with outlines and labels as orange, similar to NRCSâ€™s Web Soil Survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;A value of 100
    will result in the layer not showing at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;This transparency slider is synchronized with the one in operational
    considerations and regeneration so that the transparency will be applied to all layers in the three toolboxes.</p>

<p class="mt-2">When the soils layer is clipped to the property boundary, a table is displayed showing the percentage of
    each type of soil within the property boundary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify the type of soil, click on a table row and the
    soil type will be highlighted on the map.&nbsp;&nbsp;To unselect the highlighted area on the map, click again on the
    selected table row.&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide or show the table back click on the <b>Hide/Show Table</b> button.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To remove the clipped layer, click the <b>Clear Clipped Layer</b> button.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Click <b>Create a Report</b> to produce a PDF report that summarizes project area including a map of the
    project area boundary, a map showing the soils within the project area, and a one-page summary for each soil
    listing selected attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Optionally, a <b>Report Title</b> can be added.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Soil polygons are made available as a Web Map Service from the Soil Data Access Web Service provided by
    National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Soil attribute information is queried from the NRCS Soil
    Data Access Web Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these services use data from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO)
    database.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a description of SSURGO, please refer to the <a class="underline text-blue-700"
