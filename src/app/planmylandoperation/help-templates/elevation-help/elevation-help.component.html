<p>This toolbox contains a tool to explore an elevation profile along a user-defined path (existing or potential road or
    trail).</p>

<p class="mt-2">The toolbox contains two line-drawing tools—a polyline tool and a freehand line tool—along with a
    checkbox for using Base Sea Level as the minimum Y-axis value.&nbsp;&nbsp;To define a path, click on either
    line-drawing button and draw a path.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, an Elevation Profile chart will
    display.&nbsp;&nbsp;To produce a one-page report that displays this chart, enter a project name and click the report
    button.&nbsp;&nbsp;A PDF report will be produced that can be printed or saved.</p>
