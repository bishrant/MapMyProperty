<p>This toolbox contains a tool to determine a minimum diameter for a culvert at a particular point along a stream.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Culvert size is determined from the Minimum Culvert Sizing Chart provided in the <a class="underline text-blue-700" href="https://tfsweb.tamu.edu/uploadedFiles/TFSMain/Manage_Forest_and_Land/Water_Resources_and_BMPs/Stewardship/Texas%20BMP%20Handbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Forestry Best Management Practices Manual</a>.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Three factors go in to determining this culvert diameter: (1) area drained in acres, (2) soil texture
    (light, medium, and heavy), and (3) slope class (flat &lt;5%, moderate 5-15%, steep &gt;15%).&nbsp;&nbsp;The tool
    calculates the area in acres that are drained to a “pour-point” that is within 30 meters of the user-defined point
    and shows on the map the area that is drained (its watershed).</p>

<p class="mt-2">To calculate a culvert size, click on the <b>Draw Point</b> button and click a point on the
    map along a drainage.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be useful to refer to the topo map when doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the watershed
    will appear along with the user-defined point and the calculated pour point.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the pour
    point, which is the lowest area within 30 meters of the user-defined point, is to minimize anomalies for calculating
    the watershed size when locating a point for a culvert.</p>
