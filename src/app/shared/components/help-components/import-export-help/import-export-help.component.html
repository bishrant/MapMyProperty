<p>This toolbox allows to import and export areas, lines, points and text.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before importing or exporting the
    graphics, select the type of file to import or export including mmp, shp, kml, and gpx formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following
    briefly describes each type of file.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>Make special note of the mmp format as it allows exporting and importing all work done (including text).</b></p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>MMP</b>&mdash;Map My Property file format&mdash;This file format, native to Map My Property suite, allows
    you to export and later import all the work that has been done in a mapping session including boundaries (areas and
    circles), lines, points, and text.&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbology, such as color and width, are also exported or imported in the
    process.&nbsp;&nbsp;This option results in saving a single mmp file.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>SHP</b>&mdash;Shapefile format&mdash;Polygons, circles, lines and points can be exported and imported
    using this format.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapefile is a format used by GIS mapping application such as ESRIâ€™s
    ArcMap.&nbsp;&nbsp;This option results in saving a zip file containing a shapefile per geometry
    type.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one of the shapefiles is made up of several files and, if you have more than one type of
    graphic in your map, the downloaded zip file will contain more than one shapefile.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shapefile is
    imported, it must be in the form of a zip file, so to import a shapefile make sure all the files needed are inside a
    single zip file.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>KML</b>&mdash;Keyhole Markup Language file format&mdash;This file format is used by Google Earth and
    exporting to this format will allow loading your areas, circles, lines or points into this popular mapping
    program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, boundaries, circles, lines or points produced in Google Earth can be imported.</p>

<p class="mt-2"><b>GPX</b>&mdash;GPS Exchange Format&mdash;A device-independent data format used for GPS navigation
    devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an area, line or point on the map, the points representing these graphics will be
    exported in GPX format.&nbsp;&nbsp;To import GPX points, click the <b>Import</b> button, and your GPX points will be
    imported and displayed on the map.</p>
