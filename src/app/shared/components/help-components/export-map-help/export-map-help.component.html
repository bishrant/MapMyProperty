<p>The Export to PDF toolbox allows you to create a printable map matching the contents of your map view.&nbsp;&nbsp;You
    may enter a title and comments for the map on the <b>Title</b> and <b>Comments</b> boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that, for the
    comments, a maximum number of characters (200) and line breaks (5) are allowed.</p>

<p class="mt-2">If you do not wish to display the current date on your printed map, uncheck the <b>Show Current Date</b> checkbox and
    the current date will not appear on the map.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once satisfied with the options available, click the
    <b>Preview</b> button that will open a window where you can refine the map extent by panning and zooming.&nbsp;&nbsp;You
    can then click the <b>Generate PDF</b> button, which will open a map in PDF format in your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
    the map does not show, make sure your browser allows you to show pop-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;The map is displayed in
    landscape aspect ratio (long side horizontal).&nbsp;&nbsp;The exported file is a geospatial PDF, which allows
    viewing of map coordinates and georeference information encoded inside the PDF file, when opened in a compatible
    viewer.</p>
