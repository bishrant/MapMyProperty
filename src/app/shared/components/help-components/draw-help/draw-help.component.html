        <p class="mt-2">The Draw toolbox contains tools to draw areas (polygons and circles), lines (linear features), and
            points of interest for a boundary.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, text can be added to the map.</p>
    
        <p class="mt-2">To define areas, circles, linear features, and points, or to add text to the map, select the button
            corresponding to the drawing tool of interest to activate it and all the drawing options to style that
            element will be available.</p>
    
        <p class="mt-2">For example, to draw a boundary, select the <b>Polygon</b> <i class="customicon-untitled ml-1"
                style="line-height: 0;"></i> button and select the options for drawing mode, line style, and fill
            style.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these are set, move the cursor to the map and begin adding points at each location where
            the boundary changes direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Move the cursor in the direction of the next point and click to add a new
            point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue this until you draw the entire boundary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-clicking to add the last point
            will complete the drawing.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">To add circles, lines, points of interest, or text, follow the same steps as for area
            polygons.&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw a circle, select the <b class="mt-1">Circle</b> <mat-icon>radio_button_unchecked</mat-icon> tool and specify the drawing mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two
            options are offered, <b>Click</b> and <b>Freehand</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;By selecting <b>Freehand</b> you can draw a circle
            by hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;To use this option, move the cursor to the map, and press down the left button of the mouse at
            the location that will be the center of the circle, and start moving the cursor away from the center to define its
            size.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are satisfied with the size of the circle, release the mouse button.&nbsp;&nbsp;To create
            a circle with a specific radius distance, select the <b>Click</b> drawing mode option, enter the desired radius,
            move the cursor to the map and click on the map to specify the center of the circle.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">To draw a line, select the <b>Line</b>
            <mat-icon>show_chart</mat-icon> tool and specify the drawing mode and style options.&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear features can
            be drawn either as polylines (connected segments of straight lines) or as freehand lines, such as the way you draw
            using a pencil.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">To add points of interest or text, select the respective tool and specify the appearance options as was
            done for areas and lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the <b>Point</b> or <b>Text</b> tool, whichever is applicable, and click
            anywhere on the map to create the point or text.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">To deactivate all the drawing tools click on the <b>Clear</b> button whenever a tool is active.</p>
    </div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-body" aria-labelledby="editTab" *ngIf="!isDrawActive">
        <p class="mt-2">If you are not satisfied with the drawing and want to edit it, click on the drawn feature to select it
            and enable editing mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of editing an area, notice the blue circular points on each corner
            or vertex.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on these and drag them to a new, desired location to move these points.&nbsp;&nbsp;To
            delete an existing vertex, right-click on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;New vertices can be added by clicking on and dragging the
            "ghost" vertices (grey circular points) to the desired location.&nbsp;&nbsp;The moved ghost vertex will now show as
            a new point (blue).&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost vertices are displayed halfway between two existing points.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar
            steps can be followed to edit lines.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Points of interest can be moved by first clicking on it to select it, which will be indicated by
            changing to cyan blue color.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now click and drag it to a new location.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Text can be moved by first clicking on it and then dragging the text to the desired position using the
            input box handler.&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete the text click on the delete icon.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">If you want to move a label showing the acreage, click on the label to select it, then click and drag it
            to the new location.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not wish to display the acreage labels, uncheck the <b>Area/Distance
                Labels</b> checkbox, and vice versa.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Clicking on the <b>Delete All</b> button (at the bottom of the map) will delete all
            drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clicking the <b>Undo</b> button (also at the bottom of the map) will delete the last feature
            drawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clicking on it again will delete the next to last one drawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done to
            sequentially delete features in reverse order that they were added.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same functionality holds for the
            <b>Redo</b> button.</p>
