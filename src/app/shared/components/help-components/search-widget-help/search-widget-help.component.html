<p>The find location tool enables users to move to a location much quicker and easier than standard
    panning/zooming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Users can locate addresses, place names and coordinates in decimal
    degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The coordinates can be entered in the format <b>Lat, Lon</b> with or without the
    comma.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, to locate Texas A&M University, enter <b>30.61 -96.34</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to
    use cardinal directions you do not need to worry about the position of the coordinates as either <b>W 96.34 N
        30.61</b> or <b>N 30.61 W 96.34</b> can be entered.</p>

<p class="mt-2">You can also zoom in on your current location by clicking in the input box and then the <b>Use current
        location</b> button.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that you will need to allow location in your browser.</p>
